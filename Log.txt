Refactored noah's code
designed to allow seamless changes between types of displays and inputs
also designed to put responsibility for good board states in hands of board class (board handles all board actions, game uses board actions)
Designed minmax algo
problem: minmax algo takes too long, states blow up too quickly
Solution: generate all states of a depth of 1, play n games to completion from these states
minmax the average scores

first game, smashing record (23-06-23) 16140

added multi threading in reporter class
improved randomAI 10000 game performance from 125.42 to 32 seconds
improved MinMax_v2 10 game performance from 10520 to 2837 seconds

added multitreading to playing n random games in Gamestate class
improved first couple move speed from ~20sec to ~6sec, allowed increase of number of random games from 50 to 100 (200+ is possible but not explored)

JULY 16th

Continued refacotring code (started on July 15th)
Added TextRepresentation class for Board class
Represenation is ~3x smaller than the board class (comparing board_string vs. board array)
